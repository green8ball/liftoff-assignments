## Submission Instructions

### Overview
CCMS(Contact Center Management System)
This is scheduling, time off, and time off allotment system focused around ensuring proper staffing is in place for any given day.
Call center representatives (agents) will be able to go into the system and view their schedules, and request time off.
Workforce Management (WFM) will make changes to schedules and time off allotments based on business needs.

Being properly staffed on any given day is critical to running a successful contact center.
Specifying allotments (number of people allowed to take time off) by team and date ensures staffing needs are not compromised due to time off requests.
This results in time off requests being denied when the request would go over that allotment.
